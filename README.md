This directory contains 2 deep learning architecture models for Deep Learning and Computer Vision class at NTNU in Trondheim. The aim is training htese models on 2 datasets containing images of roaads with snow poles on their sides which will be the target to detect for out models. The 2 dataset are called: lidar and rg, and they contain, the first images captured with ir sensors and the second some real world images
